# Research Cards

## What are Research Cards

Research Cards are an open format for displaying and linking critical information related to a piece of research, analogous to a Model Card or Data Sheet. Research Cards are particularly focused on making it easier for relevant research to be found and understood by policy makers, and the public.

This project started at the Software Sustainability Insitute Collaborations Workshop in 2023, hosted at the University of Manchester.

Research Cards are an extension of RO-Crates, and include new entities specific to policy and impact.
